        "Como personagens sem nenhum carisma conseguem te prender tanto a uma narrativa? Talvez esse seja o poder da Cate Blanchett e Michael Fassbender. 🤌🏽\n\nNo filme, um casal de espiões está no centro de uma conspiração. Ela, suspeita de trair a associação, ele, disposto a ir até o fim em proteger a sua esposa. Acontece que, no Código Preto, segredos e mentiras são a especialidade de todos.\n\nSe Sr. E Sra. Smith (série) tivesse um filho com Kingsman, mas na verdade ele tivesse sido criado pelo filme Animais Noturnos eu acredito que daria nesse filme aqui.\n\nAfinal tamo falando sim de um filme de espião, mas com uma pegada bem maior de drama e suspense que de ação e investigação. A energia do filme é gasta não em planejar o acontecimento, mas pra construir todo aquele universo e personagens pra entregar um final delicioso 🤌🏽\n\nE é um filme tecnicamente super competente, com alguns incômodos na direção e fotografia, mas nada que me tirasse da experiência do filme. \n\nRecomendo pra quem curte um drama de mistério com personagens extremos e indecifráveis - e isso embalado num filme com senso de humor e pequenininho, só 1h30. Curti!\n\n🍿Onde assistir: Código Preto tá hoje nos cinemas!\n\n#review #codigopreto #cateblanchett #michaelfassbender",

        "THE DEEPEST DANCE • Our NEW short film (4 min), now playing. Turn your phone and plug in your headphones for the best viewing experience.\n\nDirected & Cinematography by @andremusgrove\nChoreography & Performance by @ariadna_hafez\nWritten by @andremusgrove & @ariadna_hafez\nProduced and Edited by @andremusgrove\nOriginal soundtrack & Sound Design by @tanismusic\n\nAfter three years of giving my all to this project, I feel so grateful to be able to finally release this project today on my birthday. I really want to thank my friend and teammate Ariadna for dedicating her talents and skills gathered over an entire career of dancing and performance across the globe to do this project together underwater in my backyard. Most of the shoot days for this project would only be Ariadna and I out on the boat doing everything: driving the boat, pulling anchor, scuba safety, lens changes, logistics, production management, etc. This is only possible with complete trust and dedication to a project between the persons involved and I wouldn’t want to have done this project with anyone else in the world. Thanks, Tanis for working with us composing this original music for yet another one of my underwater short films. Thank you to everyone who helped us with the logistics of this shoot and pulled together to make things work despite the many difficulties we faced along the way.\n\nThe full film can be watched in fullscreen 4K on my YouTube channel “@AndreMusgrove” by clicking the link in my bio or clicking the “The Deepest Dance” highlight bubble on my page. #TheDeepestDance #AndreMusgrove #AriadnaHafez #UnderwaterFilm #DanceFilm #UnderwaterPhotography #Freediving #Freediver #UnderwaterVideo",
        "Since I don’t post much about myself here, allow me to reintroduce myself. My name is André, I’m 26. I was born, raised, and am based in New Providence, Bahamas.\n\nI've been shooting underwater photography & cinematography for 8 years and started working for myself 6 years ago.\n\nI was introduced to the ocean through spearfishing and freediving at 8 years old. I was scuba certified at 16 and worked up to getting my PADI Scubadiving Instructor certification.\n\nI’m a proud Believer in the one and only true God, Jesus Christ (relationship/ life hack that is the foundation of my life) and I honor the seventh day Sabbath by choice.\n\nI don’t drink alcohol, smoke, or take any drugs. I never have and never plan to.\n\nWorking with big sharks and freedivers are my favorite. Having to perform in intense underwater scenarios is what I live for.\n\nBodybuilding is my main on-land hobby and I started at 14. If I didn’t have an underwater-focused career it would’ve probably been fitness-related.\n\nI happily have a slight addiction to coconuts.\n\nMy underwater camera journey unexpectedly introduced me to a few different roles including TV on-screen talent work, underwater stunts, private dive guide, and selling fine art prints of my work.\n\nA friend once told me to do one thing that scares you every day and this caption is mine for today. This is the first and probably the last time you'll see a caption like this about me so any other questions, you’re just gonna have to ask me yourself.",
        "Scuba diving an underground cave in the Bahamas. (Do not attempt) I knew of this cave before but only ever went in the shallow wading pool at the entrance and I was always curious to know how far it went underground, now I know. Cave diving can be very dangerous with risks of getting lost, running out of air, cave ins and getting stuck so it’s advised not to attempt any form of cave diving without the proper experience or accepting the high risk of injury or worst. #CaveDiving #Bahamas #UnderwaterExplorer",
        "Island boy no matter which side of the world I’m on. French Polynesian adventures never disappoint when you get to drink fresh coconuts in the ocean, freedive with Oceanic whitetip sharks, bike ride back to your bungalow with a basket full of coconuts and learn to sail a traditional Va’a. Also getting to see the Tahitian pearl farm sustainable operations at Robert Wan’s private island and getting a little closer with some wildlife was a solid bonus. God is good. #FrenchPolynesia #Tahiti #DiveTravel",
