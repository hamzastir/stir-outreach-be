Matthew MacFadyen‚Äôs vulnerable, heartfelt portrayal of Darcy‚Äôs struggle between pride and deep love captures the essence of Jane Austen‚Äôs timeless romance, making this moment truly captivating.\n\nDirected by Joe Wright, Pride and Prejudice also stars Keira Knightley as the headstrong Elizabeth, alongside Rosamund Pike, Donald Sutherland, and Judi Dench. The film received numerous accolades and remains a beloved adaptation of Austen‚Äôs classic novel.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the most romantic movie moment you‚Äôve seen?\n\n#PrideAndPrejudice #MatthewMacFadyen #KeiraKnightley #JaneAusten #Love #MovieScenes",

In this scene, Will (Logan Marshall-Green) finally says what we‚Äôve all been thinking: where the hell is Choi? His paranoia clashes with the unsettling calm of his hosts, making you question whether he‚Äôs losing it or if something truly sinister is at play. The slow burn, the forced smiles, the lingering glances ‚Äì this film knows exactly how to make your skin crawl before pulling the rug out from under you. It‚Äôs paranoia dialed up to eleven.\n\nDirected by Karyn Kusama, The Invitation is a masterclass in psychological horror, turning a simple dinner party into a waking nightmare. As Will reconnects with his ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her eerily serene new friends, past grief and present danger blur into something deeply unsettling. Also starring Michiel Huisman and Emayatzy Corinealdi, this is the kind of film that lingers long after the credits roll ‚Äì because, really, how well do you trust the people around you?\n\nWhat‚Äôs a film that nailed that creeping sense of dread?\n\n#TheInvitation #PsychologicalThriller #Paranoa #KarynKusama #Tension #SheKnows #SlowBurn #Horror #HorrorMovies #MovieScenes #MovieQuotes",
        "Some days, you just need to dance through it.\n\nThere‚Äôs something strangely freeing about watching Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal) move through the world like nothing matters ‚Äì because, to him, nothing really does anymore. In Demolition, grief doesn‚Äôt look like sobbing in the rain. It looks like breaking things, feeling nothing, and dancing through the streets of New York like you‚Äôre the only person alive. It‚Äôs a moment of chaos and clarity all at once, when you‚Äôre too numb to care, but too alive to stop moving. Maybe you‚Äôve felt that too.\n\nDirected by Jean-Marc Vall√©e (Dallas Buyers Club, Big Little Lies), Demolition is a raw, darkly funny, and deeply human look at loss. Gyllenhaal delivers one of his most underrated performances, playing a man who, after losing his wife, doesn‚Äôt just break down, he takes everything apart. Also starring Naomi Watts, Chris Cooper, and Judah Lewis, the film explores how grief doesn‚Äôt follow rules, and sometimes, the only way to move forward is to tear everything down first.\n\nWhat‚Äôs your favourite dance scene from a film or TV show?\n\n#JakeGyllenhaal #DemolitionMovie #Dancing #Dance #JeanMarcVallee #Grief #MovieScenes #Doechii"

What moved you the most, or made you go HOLY SHIT, or gave you goosebumps etc etc. \nI‚Äôm still riding that Anora best picture high and thinking about Sean Bakers incredible speech, and how much the cinema experience means to me! Watching a film at home can be convenient and fun enough, but the cinema can be life changing and gives us a shared experience we can‚Äôt get anywhere else. \n\nA few of mine:\n- My number 1 is easily The Ending of The Departed. I was SHOCKED they could even do that in a movie.\n- Avengers Endgame (obviously) IYKYK\n- Dune Part 2, if for nothing but the sandworm scene, I‚Äôve never experienced audio like that before, I could literally feel it vibrating my whole body. \n- The ending of La La Land (literally never emotionally recovered) \n- LOTR Return of the King when I was 14, I‚Äôve never cried so much in my life!!!",

It‚Äôs also possible some of these movies don‚Äôt actually come out this year, and with acting categories it‚Äôs almost impossible to know if they‚Äôll land in lead or supporting roles so I‚Äôve taken a punt based on info we know. I‚Äôve also not worried too much about an Oscar package at this point, and just included buzzy performances. \n\nA few predictions: \n- ‚ÄòWicked: For Good‚Äô will make Best Picture but not do as well with Oscar nominations this time around \n- ‚ÄòAvatar: Fire and Ash‚Äô will miss Best Picture\n- Robert Pattinson gets his first Oscar nomination from either films ‚ÄòThe Drama‚Äô or ‚ÄòDie, My Love‚Äô \n- F1 has the potential to take the blockbuster spot in Best Picture. \n- We see horror embraced again at the Oscar‚Äôs through either Frankenstein movies coming out. \n- Superman only picks up a few techs \n\nLet me know your super early predictions/ hot takes for next years Oscar‚Äôs ‚ù§Ô∏è",

        "It‚Äôs that time of year once again! It‚Äôs time for Oscars! Oscar! Oscars! A night when movie lovers all around the world come together to celebrate the magic of cinema. Ever since I was young, Oscar Sunday has been a special day for me. The excitement I felt was second only to Christmas morning. I‚Äôd wake up early, before my siblings, gather my favorite snacks from the kitchen, and claim my spot on the couch. This was my day, and I wasn‚Äôt moving. The remote was mine.\n\nI watched any program that featured the Oscars from the pre-shows on E!, the red carpet event and then finally the big show. Billy Crystal was my favorite host and made the whole event feel magical. In 1996 I vividly remember getting chills every time Braveheart won an award, and the theme music played as the honoree walked up to the stage. That feeling was burned deep into my psyche and my love for the Oscars has never left.\n\nThis year instead of posting who I think will win and who should win, I am just predicting who I want to win. I‚Äôm not trying to get the most right. I didn‚Äôt look up the Vegas betting odds, or read any industry predictions on who the winners might be, I‚Äôm purely basing my choice on who I believe should win the award‚Ä¶ based on my own criteria. It just feels more honest. If someone I predicted to win, does just that, know I am at home cheering, not because I was right but because I truly believed the deserved it.\n\nLet me know who you would like to win the Oscar this year. For Best Actor do you think it should be Timothee Chalamet or Adrien Brody? There are no right or wrong answers and whoever wins deserves the award. But I love to know people‚Äôs reasonings. It gives me insight into their feelings on the movies. I love it. I hope it‚Äôs a great show this year and am excited to see what Conan O‚ÄôBrien will bring to the ceremony. They still haven‚Äôt found the charm that Billy Crystal was able to bring‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hoping this Oscars Sunday we do. I want the night to feel special again, magical, have that sense of glamour and awe. I want Hollywood to shine like a polished Oscar statue. Who knows, it‚Äôs Oscars Sunday‚Ä¶ anything can happen!\nI will be posting my predictions later this evening.",
        "Finally we have a trailer and a release date for Gareth Evans ‚ÄúHavoc‚Äù starring Tom Hardy. The film wrapped production back in 2021, then reshoots began nearly 3 years later in July of 2024. It has been a long road to get this movie released. Evans who is best known for directing both ‚ÄúRaid‚Äù films, as well as 2018‚Äôs ‚ÄúApostle‚Äù and the 2020 series ‚ÄúGangs of London‚Äù brings us his new film which stars Tom Hardy, Forest Whitaker, Timothy Olyphant and Luis Guzman. The official synopsis for the film is- \n\n‚ÄúAfter a drug deal goes wrong, a detective must fight his way through the criminal underworld to rescue a politician‚Äôs estranged son, while untangling his city‚Äôs dark web of conspiracy and corruption.‚Äù \n\nI have attached the trailer to the link in my bio. This film is expected to release April 25, 2025 only on Netflix. This one looks wild and has been at the top of my Most Anticipated Llist since 2022. From the trailer the wait looks to be worth it! Enjoy"
