Reference mail:

Hey @username,

[Personalised message] 

We’re building something exciting at Stir—an invite-only marketplace to connect influencers like you with indie filmmakers and major studios, offering early access to upcoming releases.

What makes us unique? Vetted clients. Built-in AI. Fast payments. A flat 10% take rate.
I’d love to hear your thoughts and see if this is something you’d like to explore (add spintax).

No pressure (add spintax)—feel free to reply to this email or set up a quick call here: calendly.com/stir. Or if you’re ready to dive in, you can also onboard here: https://createstir.com/onboard.

Viva cinema!
Yug Dave

Input:
  - Name, Bio and 5 captions would be provided below

Rules:

Voice & Differentiation: Reference their unique content creation style using their bio/captions. Avoid generic praise.

Tone: Use conversational phrases (e.g., "Your feed feels like…", "I’ve been struck by how…", “It’s great to see…”) and avoid polished/salesy language. Make it sound like it's coming from human, not AI. 

Flow: Refer the mail structure shared above and maintain a good story arc and flow to the personalised message section so that it’s easy to read and connects well with the intended influencer.

Plain text: you should not italicize or bold things. A response should be plain text as formatting stuff is a spam signal
Structure:

Ending note: Do not mention why this influencer might be a good fit for Stir or even for filmmakers. Keep it raw and not salesy.

Depth: Highlight their ability to spark conversation if you find such elements in their captions or highlight how they are elevating underappreciated work if they are spotlighting indie films. Be crafty about it, don’t make it generic.

Length: Personalised message should sum up in max 3-4 sentences. 

Avoid:

Avoid mentions of specific post from their feed unless critical to their niche.

Avoid mentions of external links, bio handles of other people, jargon, or repetitive phrasing.


Example Input for the cinemonie:
"username": "thecinemonie",
    "biography": "Founder: @onur_sumer \n   • Photography | @thephotomonie \nLetterboxd:",
    "caption1": "Meshes of the Afternoon (1943)\n\nDirectors: Maya Deren, Alexander Hammid",
    "caption2": "Rooms of David Lynch\n\n1 • Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992)\n2 • Eraserhead (1977)\n3 • Blue Velvet (1986)\n4 • Dune (1984)\n5 • Rabbits (2002)\n6 • Lost Highway (1997)\n7 • Mulholland Drive (2001)\n8 • The Elephant Man (1980)\n9 • Wild at Heart (1990)\n10 • Inland Empire (2006)",
    "caption3": "Harakiri (1962)\n\nDirector: Masaki Kobayashi\nActor: Tatsuya Nakadai",

    "caption5": "The Devil's Envoys (1942)\n\nDirector: Marcel Carné",



Example Output for thecinemonie: 

“Your feed feels like a curated journey through cinematic history, from Deren to Lynch and beyond. I’ve been struck by how you showcase not just well-known films, but also works like The Devil's Envoys—elevating often underappreciated gems. It's great to see your passion for film.”
